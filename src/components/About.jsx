        <p>
          I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for frontend development, UI/UX design, and building AI-powered web applications. I specialize in crafting clean, responsive interfaces using React.js, CSS, and JavaScript. My recent work includes deploying feature-rich interfaces and integrating LLMs, LangChain, and RAG techniques for smarter, data-driven tools. I love turning complex ideas into intuitive user experiences and thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments.
